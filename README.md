## Lab: 26, 27, 28
1. We will create a App, footer, header and form jsx files. 
2. place all jsx files in a folder named components. 
3. create each component jsx file and place in app.jsx
4. put app.jsx file into index.js file. 
5. render app from index.js to index.html
6. get api info with form.jsx
7. when data is received, render data to dom. 
8. render new data to dom whenever new fetch happens.
9. when fetch happens render gify to page. //failed.
10. when received save url that user sends to local storage.
11. send savedUrl to History and send to app.jsx
12. render saved urls to dom. 


## Challenge Description

This application consists of components. They all work together to have a user search a url and receive api json data. Then this app will render that data to the dom.
